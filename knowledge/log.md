# Bundle log

## 2026-09-22

**Creation.** Bundle root and the `architecture/` domain created, migrating
`docs/architecture.md` into four focused concepts: `system-overview.md`,
`module-boundaries.md`, `dependency-rules.md`, and `invariants.md`.
`docs/architecture.md` itself was left in place, unedited — it remains the
source of record until a follow-up change adds a transition pointer and
updates in-repo cross-references, per the repository's documentation
migration policy (`CLAUDE.md`).

**`operations/` domain added.** `docs/security.md` migrated into two
concepts (`security-threat-model.md`, `security-supply-chain.md`) and
`docs/performance.md` into two more (`performance-principles.md`,
`performance-measurements.md`, the latter carrying a `stale_after` date
since it holds dated benchmark numbers). Both source docs left in place,
unedited, same as `docs/architecture.md` above.

**`formats/` domain added.** `docs/rsf-format.md` (the largest doc in the
repo, 1399 lines) migrated into `formats/rsf/`: `overview.md` (design
goals, compression, container header, workbook/worksheet model),
`grammar-single-sheet-body.md` and `grammar-workbook-body.md` (the two
container bodies' full version-gated field layouts),
`cross-sheet-references.md`, `values.md` (the formula value model, error
set, date serials), `dynamic-arrays.md` (spill), and `compatibility.md`
(versioning history). While transcribing `compatibility.md`'s version-bump
table, found that the source document's own narrative "Older container
revisions" section skips three real version bumps (wrap-long-rows at body
version 5, and the border-style/comments bumps at versions 10–11) that its
own earlier version-selection sections do document correctly — the table
here is built from those authoritative version-selection sections instead
of the narrative prose, and includes all of them. `docs/rsf-format.md`
itself was left in place, unedited, same as the other migrated docs.
